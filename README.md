# ZetsuboSenshi
## What is it?
Zetsubo Senshi is an attempt at implementing elements of 90’s sci-fi anime into the game and present the game in a way that it looks like it was developed in Japan in the 90’s and early 2000’s. Think of the aesthetics of 90’s mecha anime, but with gameplay elements that close enough to feel like Doom, but not exactly Doom.
 
You play as Isabel Merton, a celebrated spacefaring squirrel heroine who was last seen saving her homeworld from a trans-dimensional alien invasion, and the multiverse from a causality paradox. You are sent to a research complex that had been ravaged by an invasion of nightmarish hellions, leaving a lot of the staff dead, or worse, mutated into undead abominations. Your main mission is to find survivors and evacuate them, and if possible, seek and destroy the invaders. To help you, you are equipped with a suit of armor of your choosing that had been fitted with an advanced AI system that can synthesize incoming stimuli into data to further adapt and improve its capabilities, as well as salvage parts from downed enemies to give itself new abilities.
